HTML is like the skeleton of a cookbook webpage. It defines the structure – the title of the recipe, ingredients list, steps, and images. CSS is like the decoration of the cookbook. It makes the page beautiful by adding colors, fonts, spacing, and layouts. For example, HTML will display the recipe text, while CSS will decide how big the heading looks, what color the background is, and how neatly the recipe is arranged. Together, HTML and CSS make a cookbook webpage both readable and attractive.
								A cookbook is a collection of recipes that guides people in preparing and cooking different kinds of food. It usually includes a variety of dishes, ranging from appetizers and main courses to desserts and beverages. Along with step-by-step instructions, many cookbooks also provide measurements, cooking times, and serving suggestions to help readers achieve the best results. Some cookbooks focus on specific cuisines, dietary needs, or cooking techniques, while others serve as general guides for beginners and home cooks.

Beyond just recipes, a cookbook often reflects culture, tradition, and creativity. It can introduce readers to new flavors, ingredients, and methods from around the world, making cooking both a skill and an art form. Many modern cookbooks also include photographs, nutritional information, and tips for presentation, making them not only practical but also inspiring. In this way, a cookbook becomes more than just a manual—it is a companion in the kitchen that connects food with memory, culture, and enjoyment.
